Where my name and logo came from. 

My older brother who was named after my dad as the 2nd and would therefore have the same initials as his. Then when I was born they made my name also have the same initials, and that’s where the RAR came from. My dad was a mechanical engineer and machinist who started his own company called RAR Manufacturing back home in Cincinnati, OH. His logo, designed in early CAD was simply our initials on a downward diagonal in a large bold red block font. I always assumed red because our last name, Roth means red in German. I’m not sure on that, I’ll have to ask Dad about that. 

When I started my business I asked Dad if I could use and modify his logo. So when designing my logo I used the original concept and made it unique. I made all the letter meet together for a different look and to be able to 3D print the logo as one piece. I went with a font that was available in the CAD software, OnShape, I use for a lot of my designs. The color code for the red is the office color for the American & Texas flag.
